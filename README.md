## ICNML

This repository holds the code for my bachelor thesis and mirrors the structure of the [ICNML gitlab project](https://esc-md-git.unil.ch/ICNML),
originally written by Marco De Donno.

Each folder at the root of this repository corresponds to a separate repo in the ICNML gitlab project.
This choice was made to make it easier to track what changes and how the different repositories interact with one another
